    "Summary": "This paper proposes Automated Relational Meta-Learning (ARML), a novel framework designed to handle task heterogeneity in meta-learning. The core idea is to automatically extract and leverage relationships across tasks by constructing a meta-knowledge graph (MKG). For each task, a prototype-based relational graph is built, which then interacts with the learned MKG within a super-graph structure via a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The enriched task representation is used to modulate the meta-learner's initialization. The framework is evaluated on 2D regression and few-shot image classification datasets, including a new benchmark designed with image filters to increase heterogeneity, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance compared to various baselines and providing some analysis of the learned MKG.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses the important problem of task heterogeneity in meta-learning, which is a critical challenge for applying meta-learning in realistic scenarios.",
        "The proposed meta-knowledge graph architecture is novel and offers a flexible way to model complex relationships among diverse tasks.",
        "The idea of using prototype-based graphs for individual tasks and connecting them to a global meta-knowledge graph via a super-graph and GNN is interesting and technically sound.",
        "The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, covering different meta-learning settings and introducing a challenging heterogeneous dataset (Art-Multi) which better highlights the problem being addressed.",
        "Ablation studies provide evidence for the contribution of key components like the meta-knowledge graph and the prototype-based structure."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The clarity of some technical components could be improved, particularly the details of the autoencoder aggregators used for constructing task representations qi and ti (Equations 8 & 9). While GRUs are mentioned in the appendix, the architectural details and how they process the sets of prototypes are not fully clear in the main text.",
        "The description of the GNN used on the super-graph is very brief (stated as \"one layer GCN\"). More details on the specific message passing formulation and aggregation would enhance clarity.",
        "While ablation studies are provided, further analysis could strengthen the paper, such as ablating different configurations or architectures for the modulation function (beyond just the activation) and exploring alternative aggregator designs.",
        "The interpretability analysis, while a good effort, remains somewhat speculative. Providing a more rigorous justification for the interpretations of the meta-knowledge graph vertices would be beneficial.",
        "The computational complexity of the proposed method, especially concerning the super-graph construction and GNN propagation for each task during training, is not explicitly discussed or compared to baselines."

    "Questions": [
        "Could the authors provide more detailed architectural specifications for the autoencoder aggregators (AGq, AGq_dec, AGt, AGt_dec), including how they handle the set of prototypes?",
        "Please provide more details on the specific GNN implementation used in Equation 7, including the message passing and aggregation functions.",
        "Could the authors perform additional ablation studies, perhaps exploring different ways of implementing the modulation function (e.g., gating parameters per layer or per filter) or different types of aggregators for task representation?",
        "Can the authors provide a more detailed analysis or stronger evidence to support the interpretations of the meta-knowledge graph vertices and edges?",
        "Can the authors comment on the computational complexity and training time of ARML compared to prominent baselines, especially given the super-graph construction and GNN steps?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The authors acknowledge the sensitivity to the number of vertices in the meta-knowledge graph, suggesting more vertices might be needed for more complex datasets. This highlights a potential hyperparameter tuning challenge.",
        "The complexity of the model might make it harder to scale or train compared to simpler meta-learning approaches, although this is not explicitly discussed.",
        "The interpretability claims, while interesting, are not rigorously validated and rely on plausible explanations of visualized structures."
