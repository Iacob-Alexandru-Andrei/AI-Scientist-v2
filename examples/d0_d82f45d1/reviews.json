      "Img_description": "The figure is a gray rectangle with the word 'Image' in the center. It is clearly a placeholder graphic with no substantive content or meaningful elements such as axes, data, or annotations.",
      "Img_review": "The figure lacks any substantive content and does not contribute to the paper's scientific rigor or clarity. As a placeholder, its purpose is clear, but it should be replaced with a meaningful figure, such as a workflow diagram or an example output, to align with the paper's aim of presenting a conceptual pipeline.",
      "Caption_review": "The caption accurately describes the figure as a placeholder. While it is clear and sufficient for this purpose, it could be shortened if brevity is desired. Once a meaningful figure is included, the caption should be updated to reflect the content and provide a concise takeaway.",
      "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure adequately, explaining its placeholder nature and the envisioned role of visual elements in the final paper. However, since the figure currently lacks content, it does not enhance the reader's understanding. Replacing it with a relevant figure would improve the coherence and utility of the text references."
