    "Summary": "Both reviewers agree that the submission is not a completed research paper but appears to be a LaTeX template containing only placeholder text. The submission lacks all core content, including the actual title, abstract, introduction, proposed method, experimental setup, results, analysis, and conclusions. There is no scientific contribution, technical detail, or evaluation presented.",
    "Strengths": [
      "The submission follows a standard structure for a research paper (Introduction, Related Work, Method, Experiments, Conclusion, Appendix)."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The submission contains no actual research content, including the proposed method, experimental setup, results, analysis, or discussion.",
      "All sections contain placeholder text instead of the intended scientific contribution.",
      "It is impossible to evaluate the originality, quality, clarity, or significance of the work as it has not been presented.",
      "Claims are not supported by any evidence or technical details, as none are provided.",
      "Reproducibility is impossible due to the complete absence of method details and experimental results.",
      "The included figure and bibliography are placeholders and not relevant to any actual work."

    "Questions": [
      "Where is the actual content of the paper? The submission appears to be an incomplete template.",
      "What is the actual title and abstract?",
      "What problem does this paper address and what is the proposed method?",
      "What experiments were conducted, what are the results, and how do they compare to related work?",
      "What are the limitations and potential societal impacts of the work?"
    ],
    "Limitations": "The paper does not present any research work, thus its limitations cannot be assessed. The placeholder 'Impact Statement' is generic and insufficient, failing to address any specific potential limitations or negative societal impacts of the work (which is not described). The primary limitation is the complete absence of technical content and experimental results.",

      "Img_description": "The figure contains a bold black letter 'A' centered within a gray square. Faint guidelines radiate from the center, forming an X and a cross. There are no axes, labels, legends, or additional contextual information.",
      "Img_review": "The figure is minimalistic and lacks clear scientific or technical context. It does not include axes, labels, a legend, or explanatory elements. The purpose of the lines and the centered 'A' is ambiguous. Improvements could include adding explanatory elements or integrating it into a meaningful context to enhance its relevance.",
      "Caption_review": "The caption is missing, leaving the figure's intent unclear. A caption should explain the purpose of the figure and provide a concise takeaway. For instance, 'Figure 1. Centered letter 'A' within a gray square for alignment demonstration' would clarify its purpose.",
      "Figrefs_review": "Main text references for the figure are entirely absent ([]). Without any explanation in the text, the figure's purpose, relevance, or context in the paper cannot be assessed. Proper references should describe the figure's content and its contribution to the paper's argument or findings."
